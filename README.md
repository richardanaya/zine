# Zine using CSS (After 2024)

I was not able to find a simple 1 page zine using CSS that didn't break when I went to go print it. Be sure to switch to **landscape** when printing.

I use:
* aspect ratio to maintain zine pane size
* grid layout
* img elements by default take up fill width of zine page
* zine page has overflow hidden
